# Cosmix

Cosmix is a web audio editing platform designed to mix unique space-related sounds from NASA with a library of musical tracks. Cosmix was created by a team at Salva O'Renick in Kansas City, MO., as part of the fourth annual NASA International Space Apps Challenge.

**For additional setup information, [refer to the wiki](https://github.com/ingenology/cosmix/wiki)**

## Browser Compatibility

Please read.

Cosmix uses the **HTML5 Filesystem API** as part of it's functionality. Currently *(as of 4/19/2015)* Google Chrome is the only major web browser that uses this technology.

###Roadmap

Features in the future are:

* Naming and saving a song
* Rendering engine
* Export song to Soundcloud

###Sources

Cosmix was built off a fork of the [Web Audio Editor](https://github.com/janmyler/web-audio-editor) project by [Jan Myler](https://github.com/janmyler).

Audio resources are a mixture of NASA Space Sounds as well as loops from [Looper Man](www.looperman.com).
