# Cosmix
Cosmix is a web audio editing platform designed to mix unique space-related sounds from NASA with a library of musical tracks. Cosmix was created by a team at Salva O'Renick in Kansas City, MO., as part of the fourth annual NASA International Space Apps Challenge.

### Getting Started

**Short Keys**

```
N – Add New Track

```

_______

To begin a new project go to Track -> Add New (or hit ‘N’)

Upload your audio file, either an MP3 or WAV

Once the track is uploaded, you’ll see ‘M,’ ‘S’ and a Slider

```
M – Mute
S – Solo (Isolate the audio so that track is the only one playing)
Slider – Controls the volume
```

You can ‘Right Click’ on the colored bar to change the color of the bar, rename the track or delete the track.

The same can be done for ‘Track 1,’ ‘Track 2,’ etc.

To upload multiple tracks, repeat the process. 

You can grab the colored bar and drag to the left or right to position the start/end point.

The gray bar on the second track in this example is your selection. You can Copy ( C ), Cut (X), Split (E), which will splice it at the beginning of your selection.

You can’t cut from track 2 and paste into track 1. All work being done is specific to the track. 

###Roadmap

Features in the future are:

* Naming and saving a song
* Rendering engine
* Export song to Soundcloud
